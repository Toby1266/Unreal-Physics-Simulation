# Unreal-Physics-Simulation
The aim of this academic work was to produce a game in the style of MicroMachines within Unreal.

The challenge with this project derived from not being allowed, as per the academic brief, to use any blueprints.
Any and all things within the game (collisions, movement, asset creation etc) required to be done through C++ code.
